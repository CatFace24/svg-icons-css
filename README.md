## General process:
1) input-icons-svg folder contains several svg icons
2) generateIcons.js reads this folder and converts it into CSS classes, output into output-icons.css
3) components.css then stylizes the colour / size of compoenents using the icons via variables
4) just put these icon classes wherever you need

## Next Steps:
- Tweak javascript with newer properties (see if formatting is also possible)
- Figure out proper sizings in em
- Combine with design/colour tokens
